Fidelity X is more than just flight controller firmware.

It's a new answer to the question: "What should flight feel like?"—not optimization, but built from scratch. Every line of code serves a single purpose: to create an unprecedented intimate connection between you and your aircraft.

## Fly Your Way

**Three rate curves**, fully mixable:

- **Betaflight Rate** — The feel you know, seamless migration
- **Actual Rate** — Intuitive setup, what you set is what you get
