<div class="intro-statement" markdown>

Fidelity X is more than firmware.

It's a new answer to the question: what should flight feel like? Built from the ground up on a real-time operating system, every line of code serves a single purpose—to create the most intimate connection between you and your aircraft.

## Performance by Design

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-timer-sand:{ .lg .middle } **Real-Time Kernel**

    ---

    Beyond the single loop. Gyro sampling, attitude computation, and motor output run in parallel with microsecond precision. Every input becomes instant response

-   :material-blur:{ .lg .middle } **Intelligent Filtering**

    ---

    Precisely distinguishes real motion from noise. Razor-sharp response meets buttery-smooth feel

-   :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **Safety Guardian**

    ---

    Independent safety thread, always running, cannot be disabled. Your aircraft will only perform controlled descent—never an unpredictable crash

-   :material-atom:{ .lg .middle } **True to Physics**

    ---

    Built on rigid body dynamics. Every response behaves exactly as physics intended

## Fly Your Way

**Three rate curves**, fully mixable:

- Betaflight Rate — The feel you know, zero adjustment needed
- Actual Rate — Intuitive setup, what you set is what you get
- FlightOne Rate — Natural choice for FalcoX pilots

Yaw, Pitch, and Roll can each use different curves. Your flight style, your rules.
