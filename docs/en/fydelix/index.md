<div class="intro-statement" markdown>

Fidelity X is more than just flight controller firmware.

It's a new answer to the question: "What should flight feel like?"—not optimization, but built from scratch. Every line of code serves a single purpose: to create an unprecedented intimate connection between you and your aircraft.

## Performance by Architecture

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-lightning-bolt:{ .lg .middle } **Instant Response**

    ---

    Parallel architecture, independent tasks—from fingertip to propeller, microsecond delivery, seamlessly

-   :material-source-branch:{ .lg .middle } **Built from Scratch**

    ---

    Every line of code, born for flight—no porting, no compromise, only purity

-   :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **Progressive Protection**

    ---

    Multi-stage safety mechanisms, from signal recovery to safe landing, every stage has a plan

-   :material-tune-variant:{ .lg .middle } **Precision Filtering**

    ---

    Carefully tuned signal processing chain, where sharp response and silky feel are no longer a trade-off

## Experience from Details

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-atom:{ .lg .middle } **Physics Modeling**

    ---

    Based on rigid body dynamics, every response of the aircraft behaves exactly as it should

-   :material-compass-outline:{ .lg .middle } **One-Click Calibration**

    ---

    Sensor self-calibration, just rest for a moment—let the firmware handle the complex tasks

-   :material-palette-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Intuitive Configuration**

    ---

    Clean interface, clear logic—understand at a glance, master immediately

-   :material-record-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Lossless Recording**

    ---

    Newly developed lossless blackbox logging, your every action precisely recorded and fully restored

## Fly Your Way

**Three rate curves**, fully mixable:

- Betaflight Rate — The feel you know, seamless migration
- Actual Rate — Intuitive setup, what you set is what you get
- FlightOne Rate — Natural choice for FalcoX pilots

Yaw, Pitch, and Roll can each use different curves. Your flight style, defined by you.
