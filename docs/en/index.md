# Fidelity X

## Flight. Reimagined.

Real-time kernel · Precision filtering · Progressive protection

<div class="feature-highlight" markdown>

## Between you and the sky, just a thought away

Not optimization—reconstruction from scratch. Built from the ground up on a real-time OS, a carefully tuned signal chain ensures that sharp response and silky feel coexist. Progressive safety mechanisms keep every landing under control. From stick to prop, every control intent translates instantly and precisely into flight.

## Core Advantages

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-lightning-bolt:{ .lg .middle } **Instant Response**

    ---

    Parallel architecture, independent tasks—from fingertip to propeller, microsecond delivery, seamlessly

-   :material-source-branch:{ .lg .middle } **Built from Scratch**

    ---

    Every line of code, born for flight—no porting, no compromise, only purity

-   :material-shield-lock:{ .lg .middle } **Progressive Protection**

    ---

    Multi-stage safety mechanisms, from signal recovery to safe landing, every stage has a plan

-   :material-tune-variant:{ .lg .middle } **Precision Filtering**

    ---

    Carefully tuned signal processing chain, where sharp response and silky feel are no longer a trade-off
